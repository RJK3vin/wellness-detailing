                            <p className="font-bold">1. How long does a Mini Detail take?</p>
                            <p className="mt-4">
                                Our Mini Detail is designed for busy schedules and typically takes less than an hour to complete.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <p className="font-bold">2. What areas are cleaned in a Mini Detail?</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                                <li>Carpets and upholstery are thoroughly vacuumed to remove loose dirt, dust, and crumbs.</li>
                                <li>Hard surfaces like the dashboard, door panels, and center console are wiped down with safe and effective cleaning solutions.</li>
                                <li>Interior windows are cleaned for optimal clarity and a polished look.</li>

                            <p className="mt-4">Absolutely! While the core service focuses on these key areas, we offer optional add-ons to personalize your experience:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Leather Cleaning & Conditioning:</strong> Protect and preserve your leather seats with a professional cleaning and conditioning treatment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spot Treatment:</strong> Have a minor stain you&apos;d like addressed? We can target specific areas with our spot treatment add-on.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <div>
                            <p className="font-bold">4. Is a Mini Detail as effective as a full interior detail?</p>
                            <p className="mt-4">
                                A full interior detail provides a more comprehensive clean, including deep cleaning upholstery, shampooing carpets, and cleaning crevices. However, the Mini Detail is a perfect option for a quick refresh in between full details or for cars that are generally well-maintained.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p className="font-bold">5. How often should I get a Mini Detail?</p>
                            <p className="mt-4">
                                The frequency depends on your usage habits. We recommend a Mini Detail every 1-2 months to maintain a clean and fresh interior, especially if you eat or drink in your car frequently.
