            <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-4 text-left">
              <p>Headlights are crucial for safe nighttime driving. Over time, headlights become cloudy and discolored due to exposure to sunlight, UV rays, and environmental elements. This reduces light output, compromising visibility and posing a safety hazard.</p>
              <p className="font-bold">Here's why headlight restoration is essential:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Enhanced Nighttime Visibility:</strong> Restored headlights significantly improve nighttime visibility, allowing you to see the road and potential hazards more clearly.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Safety:</strong> Brighter headlights keep you and others on the road safe by ensuring better visibility in low-light conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Restored Appearance:</strong> Clear, bright headlights enhance your car's overall appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Resale Value:</strong> A car with clear headlights will undoubtedly fetch a higher price when you decide to sell.</li>

              <p className="text-lg">
                At Wellness Detailing, we understand you might have questions about our professional headlight restoration service. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions to help you make an informed decision:
              </p>
              <div className="space-y-8">
                <div>
                  <p className="font-bold text-lg">1. How can I tell if my headlights need restoration?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2">There are a few telltale signs:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Do you feel your headlights are dimmer than before, making it harder to see at night?</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Are your headlights cloudy, hazy, or discolored?</li>
                    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Do the headlights feel rough to the touch instead of smooth and clear?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-2">If you notice any of these signs, your headlights likely need restoration.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p className="font-bold text-lg">2. Is headlight restoration a permanent fix?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Headlight restoration can significantly improve clarity and last for several years, especially with proper care. However, headlights are continuously exposed to sunlight and environmental elements. We recommend periodic maintenance (every 1-2 years) to maintain optimal clarity and longevity.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p className="font-bold text-lg">3. Can't I just use a home headlight restoration kit?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Home kits can be an option, but they may not be as effective or long-lasting as a professional service. Professional detailers have access to advanced equipment, techniques, and high-quality products to achieve superior results.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p className="font-bold text-lg">4. Will headlight restoration damage my headlights?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Not if done properly. At Wellness Detailing, we use safe and effective techniques that avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive processes that could harm your headlights.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p className="font-bold text-lg">5. What happens if my headlights have deep scratches or cracks?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2">
                    In some cases, deep scratches or cracks might require headlight replacement. Our technicians will assess the condition of your headlights during the inspection and recommend the most suitable solution.
                  </p>

                  <p className="mt-2">
                    Headlight restoration typically takes 30-60 minutes per headlight.
