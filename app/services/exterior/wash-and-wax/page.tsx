                            <p>
                                The frequency depends on various factors like how often you drive, parking environment, and weather conditions. Generally, we recommend a wash every 2-4 weeks and a wax application every 2-3 months for optimal results.

Most packages include a multi-stage hand wash, wheel and tire cleaning, door jamb and trunk cleaning (in some packages), and a professional hand wax application. We also offer optional add-ons like clay bar treatment for paint decontamination.

                                A professional wash and wax won't worsen existing scratches. In some cases, a high-quality wax can slightly mask minor surface scratches. However, for deeper scratches, we recommend paint correction services to address them effectively.
