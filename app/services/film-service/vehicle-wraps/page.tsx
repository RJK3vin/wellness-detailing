                            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">4. Is car wrapping bad for my car's paint?</p>
                            <p>No, professional car wrap installation using high-quality vinyl will not damage your car's paint. In fact, car wrap acts as a protective layer, shielding your original paint from scratches, chips, and UV rays. Additionally, upon removal by a professional, the vinyl peels off cleanly without affecting the paint underneath.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>

                            <p>High-quality car wraps, properly cared for, can last anywhere from 5 to 7 years. Factors affecting longevity include the quality of the vinyl, exposure to sunlight and weather, and proper maintenance practices.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">6. How do I care for my car wrap?</p>
                            <p>We'll provide detailed aftercare instructions to ensure the longevity of your car wrap. Generally, hand washing with mild soap and water is recommended. Avoid using harsh chemicals or automated car washes.</p>
