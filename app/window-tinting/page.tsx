                        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-8">
                            <li><strong>Beat the Heat:</strong> Imagine stepping into a cool oasis on a scorching day. Window tint significantly reduces heat buildup inside your car by rejecting infrared rays. This translates to a more comfortable ride, especially for long journeys, and allows your air conditioning to work less efficiently, potentially saving on fuel costs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sun Protection on-the-Go:</strong> Window tint acts as a shield, blocking up to 99% of harmful UV rays. This protects you and your passengers from premature aging, sunburn, and even reduces the risk of skin cancer. Additionally, it safeguards your car's interior from sun damage, preventing fading and cracking of upholstery and leather surfaces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Privacy & Security:</strong> Window tint creates a veil of privacy, obscuring the view into your car. This discourages unwanted attention and deters potential theft by making valuables less visible. Furthermore, window tint adds a layer of strength to your car windows, making them more resistant to shattering in case of accidents or attempted break-ins.</li>
                            <li><strong>A Touch of Class & Style:</strong> Window tint offers a sleek and sophisticated aesthetic, adding a touch of personalization to your car's overall appearance. Choose from a variety of film options to achieve the perfect level of darkness and style that complements your vehicle.</li>
