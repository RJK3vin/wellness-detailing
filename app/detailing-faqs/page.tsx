                            <p><strong>What is car detailing?</strong></p>
                            <p>Car detailing is a comprehensive cleaning, polishing, and protection process for both the interior and exterior of your car. It goes beyond a regular car wash and provides a much deeper clean and a flawless finish.</p>

                            <p><strong>What are the benefits of detailing my car?</strong></p>
                            <p>There are numerous benefits to detailing your car: * Enhanced Appearance: Detailing restores your car's shine, removes imperfections, and makes it look brand new again. * Improved Value: A well-maintained car retains its resale value for longer. * Protection: Detailing services apply protective waxes and coatings that shield your car's paint from harmful elements. * Clean and Healthy Interior: Interior detailing removes allergens, dust, and dirt, creating a healthier and more enjoyable driving experience.</p>

                            <p><strong>How often should I get my car detailed?</strong></p>
                            <p>The frequency depends on your driving habits and how well you maintain your car. Generally, a professional detail is recommended every 6-12 months. More frequent detailing might be needed if you park outdoors, drive on dusty roads, or have pets in your car.</p>

                            <p><strong>What is the difference between a full detail and an interior detail?</strong></p>
                            <p>A full detail includes cleaning, polishing, and protecting both the interior and exterior of your car. An interior detail focuses solely on the car's inside, cleaning carpets, upholstery, dashboards, and other interior surfaces.</p>
