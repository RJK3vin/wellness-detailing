                <p className="mb-4">
                    At Wellness Detailing, we take immense pride in the meticulous care we provide for your car. Our detailers are experts in restoring a showroom shine and protecting your vehicle's beauty. Here's a comprehensive look at our proven detailing methodology, ensuring a flawless finish and a car that looks and feels amazing:
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Pre-Detailing Inspection:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Our detail process begins with a thorough inspection of your car's exterior and interior.</li>
                    <li>We assess the condition of the paintwork, wheels, tires, windows, and interior surfaces (for interior detailing).</li>
                    <li>This inspection helps us determine the most appropriate cleaning methods and products for your specific vehicle.</li>
                    <li>We discuss any specific concerns you may have and tailor the detailing service to your needs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Exterior Wash:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>We start by giving your car a thorough wash using the two-bucket method. This prevents cross-contamination and ensures a gentle yet effective cleaning process.</li>
                    <li>We use high-quality car wash soap that is pH-neutral and safe for your car's paintwork.</li>
                    <li>Our detailers meticulously hand-wash every inch of your car's exterior, removing dirt, grime, road film, and environmental contaminants.</li>
                    <li>Wheel wells, fender liners, and door jambs receive special attention to ensure a comprehensive clean.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Decontamination Stage (Optional Add-On):</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>For heavily soiled cars or those requiring extra care, we offer a decontamination stage as an add-on service.</li>
                    <li>This stage involves removing stubborn contaminants like tar, rail dust, and industrial fallout that a regular wash might miss.</li>
                    <li>We use clay barring, a gentle process that removes these contaminants from the paint surface, leaving it smooth and prepared for polishing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Paint Correction (Optional Add-On):</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    To achieve a flawless shine, we offer paint correction as an add-on service. This multi-stage process removes minor scratches, swirl marks, and oxidation from the paintwork.
                    Our detailers use a combination of polishing compounds and techniques to restore the paint's clarity and achieve a mirror-like finish.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Wax Application:</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    A high-quality car wax is applied by hand to create a protective layer on your car's paint. This wax repels water, protects against UV rays, and helps maintain the shine for extended periods.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Wheel & Tire Care:</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Your car's wheels and tires are not neglected! Powerful yet safe wheel cleaners remove brake dust and road grime. Tires are thoroughly cleaned and dressed with a premium protectant to restore their original luster and provide long-lasting UV protection.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Glass Clarity:</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    All exterior windows, including windshields and side mirrors, are meticulously cleaned using streak-free glass cleaner. This ensures optimal visibility and a polished look for your car.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Touches & Quality Check:</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Once the detailing process is complete, our detailers meticulously inspect your car's exterior to ensure a flawless finish, free of streaks, smudges, or missed spots.</li>
                    <li>We pay close attention to even the smallest details to deliver a truly exceptional outcome.</li>
                    <li>We present your car back to you, gleaming and looking its absolute best!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Interior Detailing (Optional Add-On):</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    For a complete clean, we offer comprehensive interior detailing services. Our detailers meticulously clean, condition, and protect all interior surfaces, from carpets and upholstery to leather seats and dashboards.
